# mmap ala Greg Smith (devcyibko)

obsconded from: https://github.com/geocar/mmap

I have modified it to compile on macOS under node version 14. My fork is at: https://github.com/devcybiko/mmap

To recompile it you should do `npm update`

This should recompile everything

NOTE: I had to do a lot of installation of supporting macOS stuff including a complete XCode install (the CLI wasn't enough)
